      <p>Students and teachers both benefit from interaction within the classroom. When students feel like their teachers know them they are less likely to leave class early, talk during class, cheat, etc. Students who study outside of class with a smaller group of students often score higher on exams and quizzes. Students feel intimidated in large classes and won’t ask questions and tend to keep to themselves. Students who reach out of this comfort zone and start study groups to discuss material have an easier time in class. Students and teachers are more comfortable in a class when they feel like they know each other and when the students feel like they know the other students. It is proven that students understand class material better when they have the opportunity to discuss and digest outside of class. The fast pace of a large lecture hall doesn’t allow for much discussion so having sessions outside of class have proven to be beneficial, though it requires students to reach out to peers that they do not know. Overall, building personal relationships with faculty and peers can highly benefit your academic career. Not only does it help to understand material better, these relationships can last well past university years and continue to benefit you through adulthood. The problem is that most university classes are offered as large lecture hall classes holding 250-400 students, these classes make it more difficult to create these relationships. </p>

    <div class="w3-col w3-container m4 l6">
<p> Q: Introduce yourself, tell us your name and what classes you teach.
    <div></div>
A: Hi, My name is Dr. Curtis Congreve and I teach Earth Systems which is MEA 100 and I also teach physical geology which is MEA 101.
    <div></div>
Q: And what would you say is the average number of students in those classes?
        <div></div>
A: An average class size for a section of MEA 100 caps out at about 95, in the fall semester is usually sits at about 95, in the spring semester one of the sections will be close to 90, one of the sections will be close to 70. Physical geology has varied but it’s usually about 130 students.
        <div></div>
Q: How much interaction do you see between your students whether that’s before or after class or even during class?
        <div></div>
        A: So it varies, and it definitely depends on each individual class, each class is different. I have some students who by the end of it they’ve got their group of friends, they’re actively participating. (MEA) 100 is good for that in a few ways, partly because we have a required lab so that means that students do have to work together in a smaller setting where they can get to know each other a little bit better but I still try in all the classes to insure that there is activities whereby people can talk with their neighbors. We try and do ice breakers in the beginning of class to make sure that everybody gets to know each other a little bit better and what I do find is that even in those big lecture halls, a few activities like just </p>

        <p>
            trying in the first few days of class to keep people from spreading out in the room, getting them to clump together, means that people are introduced to a few other people and over time they might start talking more with them. I definitely have had reports from people who have been sitting together just start working together outside of class.
            <div></div>
        Q: Do you assign group projects in your classes?
        <div></div>
A: For physical geology, the in class version, I do not assign group projects. For (MEA) 100 there are several group projects that are broken up throughout the course. Some of them are projects that could be done individually if students would prefer. There’s some video projects where students need to make a video on a specific topic associated with what we just covered.
        <div></div>
Q: Does that mean they are usually picking their groups for these projects?
        <div></div>
A: Yeah, the only time I’ve worked on something where I’m assigning groups is for an online distance course where its a lot harder to get interaction. For an  online distance course I’ll usually assign groups of 4-5 for group projects but from my past experience it’s been better to just have students find their groups if they want to. MEA 100 also has a group component to their exams. The written portion of the exam has groups of people working together on it as opposed to the multiple choice questions. I just find that students will find the people that they wanna work with and if they would prefer to work alone I like to give them that opportunity.</p>
